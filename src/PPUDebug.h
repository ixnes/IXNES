//Nothing gives me more joy than taking something apart, figuring out how it works and putting it back together
//But there's a problem with that when it comes to people
//Even when you're trying to take one apart from the inside, perhaps especially so then
//Because the harder you try to pry something open, the tighter it shuts on you
//There's an element of approaching the divine: you do so on it's terms
//In trying to find who you are you must agree to submit to whoever that is
//You must respect it before it will agree to reveal itself, before it will allow you to inspect it
//Because there is a terrible intimacy to being seen, even by ones own self
//So taking apart a thing is entirely different from taking apart a person
//Because a thing is dead
//A thing yields itself to be examined without argument
//But a person fights back
//And to see who they are they have to agree to show you
//They have to feel safe
//And if you don't feel safe with yourself you'll never know who you are
